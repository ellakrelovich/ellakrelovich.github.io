    <h1>Hi! My name is Ella! (she/her)</h1>
    <h3>I'm an Information Science Major minoring in CTD</h3>
        <p> I'm looking to work in the User Interface and User Experience fields in the future. I'm hoping
            to use this class to grow my website building abilities and apply my design skills to them!
        </p>
        <p> In my free time I am a DJ for Radio 1190. I host a show called Bottle Rockets (Wednesdays at 2:00). 
            I am also the tresurer of Laser Tag and Pancakes club!</p>
        <p> When I am in my apartment you can usually find me developing concepts for a single player rpg game or crocheting. </p>
