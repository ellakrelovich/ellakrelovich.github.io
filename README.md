![Ella Krelovich Headshot 2024 (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf3fa96-93c8-4752-8a94-628fad90f266) As an information scientist, I am particularly passionate about human centered technology and process design. My design process often begins with qualitative data analysis, highlighting how information flows throughout interacting with a product, process, or person. One of my favorite parts of the process is interviewing people who are involved wi!
th what I am studying. From there, I highlight frictions within the flow and propose informed and creative solutions that are focused on improving the experience of being a part of the studied information flow. If a situation calls for quantitative analysis, I use my experience with Python and the Pandas library to analyze data and create data visualizations that make key discoveries more clear.
